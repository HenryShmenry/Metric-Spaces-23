# Metric Space 2023 - 2024 with Jason Levesley

These are my notes for the Metric Spaces module at York University lectured by Jason Levesley. I am still learning how to properly format LaTeX and produce pictures using Tikz, so do feel free to point out any errors in my code!

---

The lectures are based on [Satish Shirali & Harkrishan L. Vasudeva's Metric Spaces](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/1-84628-244-6) and [Michael O Searcoid's Metric Spaces](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-84628-627-8).
